# 0%: A flat road
# 1-3%: Slightly uphill but not particularly challenging. A bit like riding into the wind.
# 4-6%: A manageable gradient that can cause fatigue over long periods.
# 7-9%: Starting to become uncomfortable for seasoned riders, and very challenging for new climbers.
# 10%-15%: A painful gradient, especially if maintained for any length of time
# 16%+: Very challenging for riders of all abilities. Maintaining this sort of incline for any length of time is very painful.
